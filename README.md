# Covid-19-Future-Forecasting
Project Description
1)	Description:
	Definition:
-	Project is concerned with the forecasting of Covid-19 spread on the basis of historic data. 
-	Target is on making future forecast for three parameters of the disease for upcoming 10 days. The first parameter is predicting on the number of new confirmed cases, secondly number of death cases and thirdly number of recovery cases.

	Data set details:
-	Focus is mainly on three dataset: the number of new positive cases, the number of deaths and the number of recoveries.
-	The dataset used is obtained from GitHub repository provided by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering, Johns Hopkins University. 
-	The repository was prierly made available in 2019 for visual dashboard of 2019 Novel Coronavirus by the university and was supported by ESRI Living Atlas team. 
-	GitHub Link for the dataset: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series
-	The folder contains daily time series summary tables, including number of confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries.
 
 
 
 
	Feature taken:
-	Date wise columns and no. of days to be considered.

	Algorithms used:
-	There are different ML models we use for predictions and future forecasting. In this project the main concern is to predict the number of future patients those are affected by covid – 19.
-	For this we can use many different algorithms for analysis. In this project I will use 4 ML models(Linear Regression, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, Support Vector Machine, Exponential Smoothing) for comparing which can give more accuracy. Using the dataset we focus on making predictions for number of newly affected cases, number of deaths and number of recoveries for further 10 days.
